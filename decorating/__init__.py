    DECORATING: A MODULE OF DECORATORS FROM HELL

    You have that collection of decorators:

    * animated: create animations on terminal until the result's returns
    * cache: returns without reprocess if the give input was already processed
    * counter: count the number of times whose the decorated function is called
    * debug: when returns, print this pattern: @function(args) -> result
    * count_time: count the time of the function decorated did need to return
